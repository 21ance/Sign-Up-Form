# Sign-Up Form
This is a sign-up form, written using HTML and native CSS. I used Flexbox to layout parts of the website. I did code everything from scratch, but the design and instructions are from The Odin Project - [Project: Sign-Up Form.

I've used media queries in an attempt to make the design responsive... at the very least, it's not completely broken on different view ports.

You can see some screenshots and link to the live site!
